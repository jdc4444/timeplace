The most important event is the \"Serenata de Lima,\" held on the night of January 17th, leading up to midnight with fireworks and concerts. A week-long schedule includes open-air serenades, massive gastronomic fairs, and spectacular parades showcasing the cultural tapestry of South America's gastronomic capital. The heart of celebrations beats in the Plaza de Armas, where official ceremonies are attended by political figures, followed by grand military and school parades. Marching bands and colorful traditional costumes fill the streets. While a major celebration in the capital, it is a non-working day specifically for Lima Province, not a national holiday.
